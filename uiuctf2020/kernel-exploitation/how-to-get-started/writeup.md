# How to get Started

## Challenge Description

Welcome to pwnyOS!

To get your credentials to access pwnyOS, please visit: [https://uiuc.tf/pwnyos](https://uiuc.tf/pwnyos)

More information about pwnyOS, and how to connect to a VNC server can be found here: [https://github.com/sigpwny/pwnyOS-2020-docs](https://github.com/sigpwny/pwnyOS-2020-docs)

## Solution

The GitHub page contains 3 documents, each worthy of reading since they describe how the system works, what kernel the system runs and what syscalls are available. These documents are `Getting_Started.pdf`, `Syscalls.pdf`, `README.md`. Here we have to give credits to the SIGPwny security club (CTF organisers) because they have handwritten the OS and the kernel for this CTF specifically.

After reading the `README.md` we see the flag at the end of the file:

`uiuctf{read_the_docs_carefully!}`

## Conclusions

Again, many thanks to the SIGPwny security club for their custom kernel.
